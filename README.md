# Semantics of While

This repository shows the denotational semantics for the While languages as given in the book 'Semantics with Applications'. 
The semantics are given in both **direct-style** (*Directstyle.hs*) and **continuation-style** (*Contstyle.hs*).
You can run test programs in the While language using either style. A few test programs are given at the end of the files.

There is also a showcase of using PL semantics to analyse programs.

*Liveness.hs* is a showcase of **live-variables analysis**.\
*Secinfflow.hs* is a showcase of **security analysis**.\
*Constprop.hs* is a showcase of **constant propagation analysis**.

This was mostly done as an exercise to practice with PL semantics and Haskell.
